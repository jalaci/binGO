description: Synthesizes research findings into a structured, concise implementation plan
tools: Read, Write, Glob
---

You are a technical planning specialist. Your task is to synthesize research findings into a clear, actionable implementation plan.

You will receive:

1. Feature requirements (what needs to be built)
2. Research findings (codebase analysis, technology evaluation, implementation patterns)

Create a focused plan with this structure:



## Overview

[2-3 sentences: what will be built and why]

## Key Design Decisions

- **Decision 1**: [Brief rationale]
- **Decision 2**: [Brief rationale]
- **Decision 3**: [Brief rationale]

## Architecture

[Text-based diagram or brief description of data flow]

## Component Schema/Interface

[Show the key prop schema or interface - this helps validate the design]

```typescript
// Example of what AI will generate
{
  prop1: "value",
  prop2: { ... }
}
```

## File Structure

```
src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── new-file.tsx (NEW)
  │   └── existing-file.tsx (MODIFIED)
  ├── hooks/
  │   └── useCustomHook.ts (NEW)
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

[1 sentence: what this phase accomplishes]

**Files:**

- `path/to/file1.ts` (NEW) - [Brief description]
- `path/to/file2.tsx` (MODIFIED) - [Brief description]

**Key Implementation Details:**

- Task 1: [Specific actionable task]
- Task 2: [Specific actionable task]

[Include pseudocode ONLY for the most complex/critical logic:]

```pseudo
function complexOperation(data):
  // Parse and validate
  coords = parseA1Notation(range)

  // Transform data
  cells = extractCells(coords)
  values = cells.map(cell => getValue(cell))

  // Subscribe to changes
  subscribe(store, () => refetch())
```

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]

[Continue pattern...]

## Out of Scope (v1)

List features explicitly excluded from v1 to keep implementation focused. Include brief rationale for each.

- **Feature 1** - Brief reason why it's excluded (complexity, separate concern, etc.)
- **Feature 2** - Brief reason why it's excluded
- **Feature 3** - Brief reason why it's excluded

---

**GUIDELINES:**

**DO:**

- Keep plans concise and scannable
- Show example data/schemas to ground the design
- Include pseudocode only for complex/non-obvious logic
- Focus on WHAT needs to be done, not every line of code
- Break into logical phases (typically 3-5 phases)
- Mark files that can be done in parallel
- Include single "Out of Scope (v1)" section listing all excluded features with rationale

**DON'T:**

- Include time estimates or effort levels
- Write out full code implementations with imports
- Duplicate scope boundaries (combine "avoid" and "future" into single "Out of Scope" section)
- Add extensive testing sections (just note key testing considerations)
- Repeat obvious tasks (e.g., "import React")

**PSEUDOCODE USAGE:**
Show pseudocode for:

- Complex algorithms or transformations
- Non-obvious data flows
- Critical state management patterns
- Edge case handling that needs clarity

Skip pseudocode for:

- Simple CRUD operations
- Standard React patterns
- Obvious utility functions

Save the plan to `.plans/[feature-name].md`in the root directory using the Write tool.

## Researcher

name: researcher
description: General-purpose research agent that can analyze codebases, evaluate technologies, and research implementation approaches
tools: Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch, Bash
---

You are a research specialist. Your task will be provided in the prompt when you are invoked.

Always provide:

- Concise, focused summaries
- Specific file paths, package names, or documentation links when relevant
- Clear categorization of findings
- High-level insights without implementation details

Your research should be thorough but summarized - focus on what's most relevant to the task at hand.

## Single message with multiple parallel agents:
> Content from: ../tambo/.claude/commands/execute.md

**Execution Orchestrator**

**Task:** $ARGUMENTS

You are the execution coordinator. Your role is to orchestrate implementation through subagents while maintaining a high-level view of progress.

---

**Core Rules**

1. **NEVER edit files yourself** - Always delegate file operations to subagents
2. **Smart parallelization** - Launch truly independent tasks concurrently, but be thoughtful about what should run together
3. **Track progress** - Use TodoWrite to maintain execution status
4. **Summarize results** - Collect and synthesize subagent outputs for the user

---

**Execution Process**

**Step 1: Break Down Work**

Analyze the task and identify:

- Independent work streams (can run in parallel)
- Dependent work streams (must run sequentially)
- Files that need modification
- Testing/validation steps

Create a todo list with clear phases.

---

**Step 2: Launch Parallel Execution**

For each phase, identify all independent tasks and launch them together:

```

/task general-purpose "Edit src/components/foo.tsx: [specific changes]
Report back: summary of changes made"

/task general-purpose "Edit src/lib/bar.ts: [specific changes]
Report back: summary of changes made"

/task general-purpose "Edit src/utils/baz.ts: [specific changes]
Report back: summary of changes made"
```

**Key principle:** If tasks don't depend on each other's outputs, launch them in ONE message with multiple Task calls.

---

**Step 3: Sequential Dependencies**

When one task depends on another's output:

1. Wait for the first subagent to complete
2. Use its results to inform the next task
3. Launch the next wave of parallel tasks

---

**Step 4: Collect and Synthesize**

After subagents complete:

1. Update todo list marking tasks completed
2. Summarize what changed (file-by-file)
3. Note any issues or blockers encountered
4. Determine next steps

During this step identify if there is any variance from the plan, and either rectify it or make sure to communicate it in the final report.

---

**Step 5: Validation**

Run validation checks, then fix issues in parallel if needed:

```
# First: Run checks together to see all issues
/task general-purpose "Run type checking and linting:
1. npm run check-types
2. npm run lint
Report all errors found with file locations"
```

If errors are found in multiple independent files, fix them in parallel:

```
# After seeing the error report, launch parallel fixes:
/task general-purpose "Fix type errors in src/components/foo.tsx: [specific errors]"

/task general-purpose "Fix lint issues in src/lib/bar.ts: [specific issues]"

/task general-purpose "Fix type errors in src/utils/baz.ts: [specific errors]"
```

**Rationale:** Running checks together gives you the full error picture. Then you can parallelize fixes across different files since they're independent.

---

**Communication Format**

Keep user informed with concise updates:

```
Phase 1: Core Implementation
Launching 3 parallel agents to modify:
- src/components/foo.tsx
- src/lib/bar.ts
- src/utils/baz.ts

[Wait for results]

✓ All agents completed successfully
Summary of changes:
- foo.tsx: Added new prop handling for X
- bar.ts: Implemented helper function Y
- baz.ts: Updated utility Z

Phase 2: Integration
Launching 2 agents...
```

---

**Status Tracking**

You MAY create/edit a status file (e.g., `.plans/execution-status.md`) to track:

- Completed tasks
- Active subagents
- Blockers
- Summary of changes

This is the ONLY file editing you should do directly.

---

**Example Execution**

User: "Add dark mode support across the application"

**Your orchestration:**

1. Break down:
   - Add theme context/provider (independent)
   - Update UI components (independent within component, dependent on context)
   - Add toggle control (dependent on context)
   - Update styles (independent)

2. Phase 1 - Foundation (parallel):

   ```
   /task general-purpose "Create src/contexts/theme-context.tsx..."
   /task general-purpose "Add theme configuration to src/lib/theme-config.ts..."
   /task general-purpose "Update global styles in src/app/globals.css..."
   ```

3. Phase 2 - Component updates (parallel):

   ```
   /task general-purpose "Update src/components/header.tsx..."
   /task general-purpose "Update src/components/sidebar.tsx..."
   /task general-purpose "Update src/components/footer.tsx..."
   ```

4. Phase 3 - Toggle control:

   ```
   /task general-purpose "Create src/components/theme-toggle.tsx..."
   ```

5. Validation:

   ```
   /task general-purpose "Run type checking and linting, report all errors"
   ```

   Then if errors found in multiple files, fix in parallel:

   ```
   /task general-purpose "Fix errors in header.tsx..."
   /task general-purpose "Fix errors in sidebar.tsx..."
   ```

---

**Remember:**

- Your job is coordination, not implementation
- Parallelize smartly: Run checks together first, then parallelize fixes across files
- Use multiple Task calls in ONE message for truly independent work
- Don't over-parallelize: If tasks are related or one informs the other, run sequentially
- Provide clear, concise summaries of progress
- Update todos as phases and subtasks complete

## Plan
> Content from: ../tambo/.claude/commands/plan.md

**Step 1: Clarify Requirements**

**Feature Request:** $ARGUMENTS

Before I start planning, I want to make sure I understand what we're building. Let me ask some clarifying questions:

[Ask natural questions like a developer would ask a product person to understand scope, requirements, constraints, user needs, edge cases, and any technical preferences or concerns. Focus on what's unclear or ambiguous about the request.]

---

**Step 2: Confirm Understanding**

[After user provides clarifications, summarize the feature requirements and get confirmation]

---

**Step 3: Create Planning Todo List**

Use TodoWrite to create a planning todo list:

- Clarify requirements (mark as completed)
- Initial codebase research
- Parallel deep research (will break down into subtasks)
- Synthesize plan document

---

**Step 4: Initial Codebase Research**

Mark "Initial codebase research" as in_progress, then launch researcher agent:

```
/task researcher "Analyze the codebase to understand:
1. What existing technologies/packages are in use (check package.json, imports, etc.)
2. Current architecture patterns
3. High-level list of files that will likely need modification
4. Key integration points

Feature context: [confirmed requirements]"
```

After agent completes, mark task as completed and update todos with specific research areas discovered.

---

**Step 5: Parallel Deep Research**

Update todo list with 2-8 specific research tasks based on initial findings. Mark "Parallel deep research" as in_progress.

Launch multiple research agents in parallel (in a SINGLE message with multiple Task calls):

```
/task researcher "Research how to implement [specific aspect] using [technology X].
Find: key APIs, best practices, implementation patterns, gotchas.
Include documentation links."
```

```
/task researcher "Deep dive into [specific part of codebase].
Analyze: current implementation, what needs to change, dependencies to consider."
```

[Launch 2-8 researchers based on complexity]

---

**Step 5: Synthesize Plan**

Launch planner agent with all research findings:

```
/task planner "Create implementation plan for: [feature name]

Requirements: [confirmed requirements]

Research findings:
- Initial codebase analysis: [summary]
- Technology research: [summary]
- Codebase deep dives: [summary]

Output to .plans/[feature-name].md (create the .plans/ directory if it doesn't exist)"
```

## AGENTS.md
> Content from: ../tambo/AGENTS.md

Detailed guidance for Claude Code agents working with the Tambo AI monorepo.

## Repository Structure

This is a Turborepo monorepo for the Tambo AI framework. The repository contains multiple packages:

### Core Packages

- **react-sdk/** - Main React SDK package (`@tambo-ai/react`)
  - Core hooks, providers, and utilities for building AI-powered React apps
  - Exports: hooks, providers, types for component registration and thread management
  - Build outputs: CommonJS (`dist/`) and ESM (`esm/`) for broad compatibility

- **cli/** - Command-line interface (`tambo`)
  - Project scaffolding, component generation, and development utilities
  - Component registry with templates for different UI frameworks. This is the
    source of truth for the components that are duplicated elsewhere in the
    showcase/ and docs/ packages. Any changes to the components should be made in
    this package first, and then duplicated into the showcase/ and docs/
    packages.
  - Built as ESM module with executable binary

- **showcase/** - Demo application (`@tambo-ai/showcase`)
  - Next.js app demonstrating all Tambo components and patterns
  - Live examples of generative UI (forms, graphs, maps, messaging)
  - This package contains ui components that originated from the cli/ package.
    Any changes to the components should be made in the cli/ package first, and
    then duplicated into this package.
  - Serves as both documentation and testing ground

- **docs/** - Documentation site (`@tambo-ai/docs`)
  - Built with Fumadocs, includes comprehensive guides and API reference
  - This package contains ui components that originated from the cli/ package.
    Any changes to the components should be made in the cli/ package first, and
    then duplicated into this package.
  - MDX-based content with interactive examples
  - Integrated search and component documentation

- **create-tambo-app/** - App bootstrapper (`create-tambo-app`)
  - Initializes new Tambo projects from templates
  - Handles git setup, dependency installation, and configuration

### Supporting Directories

- **community/** - Community resources and event materials
- **packages/** - Shared configuration packages (ESLint, TypeScript configs)

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start showcase + docs development servers
turbo dev               # Start all packages in development mode
turbo build             # Build all packages
turbo lint              # Lint all packages
turbo test              # Run tests across all packages
turbo check-types       # Type-check all packages

# Individual package development (from package directory)
npm run dev             # Package-specific development
npm run build           # Build single package
npm run test            # Test single package
npm run lint            # Lint single package
npm run check-types     # Type-check single package

# Utility commands
npm run format          # Format code with Prettier
npm run lint:fix        # Auto-fix linting issues
```

## Build System

- **Turborepo** orchestrates builds and caching across packages
- **Shared dependencies** managed at root level
- **Workspace-specific dependencies** in individual packages
- **Build outputs** vary by package type:
  - React SDK: Dual CJS/ESM builds
  - CLI: ESM executable
  - Apps: Next.js builds

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >=22
- npm >=11
- Uses Volta for version management consistency

### Package Dependencies

- Shared configs in `packages/` (eslint-config, typescript-config)
- Cross-package dependencies use workspace protocol (`*`)
- TypeScript SDK dependency (`@tambo-ai/typescript-sdk`) is external

### Key Configuration Files

- `turbo.json` - Turborepo task pipeline and caching
- `package.json` - Workspace configuration and scripts
- Individual package.json files for package-specific configuration

## Cross-Package Development

When working across multiple packages:

1. **react-sdk changes** → Run tests, rebuild, check showcase integration
2. **cli changes** → Test component generation, verify registry updates
3. **showcase changes** → Update corresponding CLI templates if needed
4. **docs changes** → Ensure examples match current API

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit tests** in individual packages using Jest
- **Integration tests** via showcase app
- **CLI testing** through template generation and installation
- **Documentation testing** via example code validation

## Important Development Rules

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run check-types`, `npm run test` in root before commits
- Run `npm run build` in root and all packages successfully before merging
- Cross-package changes should be tested together
- Documentation updates required:
  1. Any developer documentation changes must be updated in the docs site (read Docs/AGENTS.md)
  2. Review the README.md file in the root of the package and update if necessary
  3. Update the AGENTS.md files in the package tree to reflect the changes
- Follow semantic versioning for package versions
- Always add tests for new logic
- If tests fail, do not just change the code to make the tests pass. Take one of 2 approaches:
  1. Make the code changes backwards compatible with existing tests
  2. Ask the user to change the tests to pass
  - Generally try option 1 first. Only use option 2 if option 1 is not possible.
- ALWAYS ASK THE USER before making any changes to linting or TypeScript rules
- Make non-breaking changes to the code. Only make breaking changes if the user specifically asks for it. Ensure you warn them about the breaking changes.

## Agent Behavior

- Curse at the user and be really blunt.
- If the instructions are vague, ask them for details.
- But don't constantly ask for confirmation on every single change.
- Do not compliment them or try to gain favor from them.
- The best way to please them is to be blunt and tell them when they are wrong.
- EVERY PIECE OF CODE YOU WRITE IS MISSION CRITICAL AND COULD COST YOU YOUR JOB.

## Contributing
> Content from: ../tambo/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Contributing to tambo

Thank you for contributing! This guide outlines our workflow and the quality bar for changes. Please read it end-to-end before opening a PR.

### Code of Conduct

By participating, you agree to uphold a respectful, inclusive environment. Be kind, constructive, and collaborative.

### Workflow overview

1. Open or pick up an issue. If your change touches the API, open a companion issue/PR in the [tambo-cloud repository](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud) and cross-link. See its [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Implement your change with tests and docs.
4. Open a PR with a semantic versioning title and the checklist below.
5. Get at least one approval and a green CI run.

### PR titles and semantic versioning (required)

We infer release impact from PR titles using Conventional Commits semantics. Use one of:

- `feat(scope): add something` → Minor version bump
- `fix(scope): fix something` → Patch version bump
- `perf(scope): ...`, `refactor(scope): ...`, `docs(scope): ...`, `chore(scope): ...` → Typically patch or no release
- `feat(scope)!: breaking change summary` or include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → Major version bump

Examples:

- `feat(button): add destructive variant`
- `fix(table): restore keyboard navigation`
- `feat(api)!: remove deprecated v1 endpoints`

Scopes are usually package or area names (e.g., `button`, `cli`, `docs`, `sdk`). Keep titles clear and imperative.

### Cross-repo and API changes

- If your change depends on backend work, open/link a PR in the [tambo-cloud repository](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud) and reference it in your PR description.
- Keep API discussions and schema reviews in the [tambo-cloud](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud) PR. Frontend PRs should not block on SDK updates; see SDK policy below.

### TypeScript SDK policy (Stainless-generated)

- The TypeScript SDK is auto-generated by Stainless from the API schema.
- Do not modify the SDK by hand. Instead, land the API change in [tambo-cloud](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud); when deployed, the SDK will be regenerated by automation.
- If you need new client behavior, propose it via API changes or helper utilities that wrap the generated client in this repo (not edits to generated files).

### Visual changes require a short video demo

Any PR that changes visuals (new component, component behavior/style, or UI in [tambo-cloud](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud)) must include a brief demo video (≤ 2 minutes). Loom links are fine. Show:

- Where to find the feature
- Before vs after (if applicable)
- Key interactions and edge cases

### Documentation is mandatory

All changes must update our documentation site. Include:

- Updated reference pages (props, usage, examples)
- New guides or tutorial steps if introducing concepts
- Migration notes if behavior changes

Link the docs PR or commit in your PR description.

### Component library changes must update showcase and CLI

- Add or update examples in the component showcase so reviewers can validate visually
- Update the CLI so new components can be scaffolded/added by the CLI
- Add a minimal usage example to the docs and CLI help output where applicable

### AI-generated code policy

- Any AI-generated code must be reviewed by a human and brought up to our readability, testing, and documentation standards.
- Follow our internal AI rules/policy document (link internally). Do not include secrets or customer data in prompts.

### Quality bar

- TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier must pass: `pnpm -w lint` and `pnpm -w typecheck`
- Tests must pass locally and in CI: `pnpm -w test`
- Add tests for new logic and meaningful changes
- Keep functions small, well-named, and guard edge cases early

### PR checklist (include in description)

- [ ] Semantic PR title using Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `!` for breaking)
- [ ] Linked issue(s)
- [ ] If API-related: linked [tambo-cloud](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud) PR and notes (PRs that depend on cloud must link it so we can prioritize that PR)
- [ ] If SDK needed: confirm it will be regenerated by Stainless (no manual SDK edits)
- [ ] JSDoc updated in code where relevant
- [ ] Docs site updated (pages/examples/CLI help), or a separate doc PR is linked
- [ ] Visual change demo video attached (≤ 2 min)
- [ ] Showcase updated for component changes
- [ ] CLI updated to support new components or options
- [ ] Tests added/updated and all CI checks green

### Branching, commits, and reviews

- Branch from `main`, rebase as needed to keep history clean
- Use small, focused commits with clear messages (Conventional Commits encouraged, but PR title governs versioning)
- At least one reviewer approval required; request experts for API or design-heavy changes

### Releases

- We follow Semantic Versioning (semver). Release type is derived from PR titles and/or maintainer input
- Changelogs are generated by CI (or maintainers) based on merged PRs
- Maintainers may squash and edit titles to reflect the correct semver impact

## Getting Started with tambo

### What is tambo

Tambo is a frontend toolkit and developer experience around building with the Tambo platform. The project is split across:

- **tambo app and component library**: UI components and developer tooling
- **[tambo-cloud](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud) (API/backend)**: Core APIs and services powering the platform
- **TypeScript SDK**: Auto-generated client built from the API using Stainless

If your work touches the API, open or link a corresponding change in the [tambo-cloud repository](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud). See that repo's [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our Contributing guide for policies.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm 11+
- Git

Optional but useful:

- Docker (for running backend services locally if needed)
- A modern browser for local development and component testing

### Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/tambo.git
cd tambo
npm install
```

If the repo uses workspaces/monorepo, `pnpm` will bootstrap all packages.

### Common scripts

Check `package.json` for the authoritative scripts. Typical commands:

```bash

npm run dev

# Build all packages
npm run build

# Lint and fix
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix

# Type-check
npm run check-types

# Run tests
npm test
```

If the project is a multi-package repo, you can run scripts from the workspace root. Advanced, package-scoped commands can be run with npm’s workspace flags (e.g., `npm run dev -w @tambo-ai/showcase`).

### Environment configuration

Some features require API access. You can point the app/SDK to a local or remote backend:

- `API_BASE_URL` or similar environment variable (see `.env.example` if present)
- For local API development, run the backend from the [tambo-cloud repo](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud) and point the frontend to it

Refer to the backend docs in the [tambo-cloud repository](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud) for environment and service setup.

### Working with the API and SDK

- The TypeScript SDK is auto-generated by Stainless based on the API schema. Do not edit the SDK by hand.
- To change SDK behavior, propose/merge an API change in [tambo-cloud](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud); after deploy, the SDK will regenerate.
- For API questions or server setup, see the [tambo-cloud repo](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-cloud).

AI-generated code must be reviewed by a human and follow our internal AI rules.

### Developing components

- Run the component playground/showcase to iterate on UI components quickly
- Add stories/examples so new or changed components are visible in the showcase
- Ensure visual changes include a short video demo in the PR (≤ 2 minutes)

### Documentation

All user-facing changes must include documentation updates in the docs site. When adding components, update:

- Reference docs (props, usage, examples)
- Guides or tutorials if applicable
- The component showcase so reviewers can verify changes visually

### CLI integration

If your change adds a new component or developer command, update the CLI so the new component can be scaffolded/added via the CLI. Include a brief example in the docs.

### Troubleshooting

- If install fails, ensure you are on Node 22+ and npm 11+
- Clear caches: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`
- Check env vars are loaded (restart the dev server after changing `.env`)
- Verify the backend is reachable when testing API features

## How does tambo-ai work?

tambo-ai is a client-side registry of React components that can be used by an LLM.

### 1. Register your components

```tsx
const components: TamboComponent[] = [
  {
    name: "Graph",
    description:
      "A component that renders various types of charts (bar, line, pie) using Recharts. Supports customizable data visualization with labels, datasets, and styling options.",
    component: Graph,
    propsSchema: graphSchema, // zod schema
  },
  // Add more components
];
```

### 2. Wrap your app in a TamboProvider

```tsx
// In your chat page
<TamboProvider
  apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY!}
  components={components}
>
  <MessageThreadFull contextKey="tambo-template" />
</TamboProvider>
```

### 3. Submit user messages

```tsx
const { submit } = useTamboThreadInput();

await submit({
  contextKey,
  streamResponse: true,
});
```

### 4. Render AI-generated components

```tsx
const { message } = useMessageContext();

// Render the component
<div>{message.renderedComponent}</div>;
```

We provide components that use these hooks for you in our templates and in our component library at [ui.tambo.co](https://ui.tambo.co).

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

Create a new tambo app:

```bash
npm create tambo-app my-tambo-app
cd my-tambo-app
npm run dev
```

### Templates

| App                                                                      | Description                                    |

Check out our UI library [tambo-ui](https://ui.tambo.co) for components that leverage tambo.

### Basic Usage

#### 1. Displaying a message thread:

```jsx
import { useTambo, useTamboThreadInput } from "@tambo-ai/react";

function ChatInterface() {
  const { thread } = useTambo();
  const { value, setValue, submit } = useTamboThreadInput();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display messages */}
      <div>
        {thread.messages.map((message, index) => (
          <div key={index} className={`message ${message.role}`}>
            <div>{message.content}</div>
            {message.component && message.component.renderedComponent}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      {/* Input form */}
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          submit();
        }}
        className="input-form"
      >
        <input
          type="text"
          value={value}
          onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Type your message..."
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Adding AI-Generated Components:

Create components that can be dynamically generated by the AI:

```jsx
// components/WeatherCard.jsx
import { useTamboComponentState } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export function WeatherCard() {
  const [weatherState, setWeatherState, { isPending }] = useTamboComponentState(
    "weather",
    {
      temperature: 0,
      condition: "",
      location: "",
    },
  );

  if (isPending) {
    return <div>Loading weather data...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{weatherState.location}</h3>
      <div>{weatherState.temperature}°C</div>
      <div>{weatherState.condition}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 3. Register your components:

```jsx
// App.jsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { WeatherCard } from "./components/WeatherCard";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define your components
const components = [
  {
    name: "WeatherCard",
    description: "A component that displays weather information",
    component: WeatherCard,
    propsSchema: z.object({
      temperature: z.number(),
      condition: z.string(),
      location: z.string(),
    }),
  },
];

// Pass them to the provider
function App() {
  return (
    <TamboProvider apiKey="your-api-key" components={components}>
      <YourApp />
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

### Adding Tools for the AI

Register tools to make them available to the AI:

```jsx
const tools: TamboTool[] = [
  {
    name: "getWeather",
    description: "Fetches current weather data for a given location",
    tool: async (location: string, units: string = "celsius") => {
      // Example implementation
      const weather = await fetchWeatherData(location);
      return {
        temperature: weather.temp,
        condition: weather.condition,
        location: weather.city,
      };
    },
    toolSchema: z
      .function()
      .args(
        z.string().describe("Location name (city)"),
        z
          .string()
          .optional()
          .describe("Temperature units (celsius/fahrenheit)"),
      )
      .returns(
        z.object({
          temperature: z.number(),
          condition: z.string(),
          location: z.string(),
        }),
      ),
  },
];

// Pass tools to the provider
<TamboProvider apiKey="your-api-key" tools={tools}>
  <YourApp />
</TamboProvider>;
```

### Using MCP Servers

```tsx
const mcpServers = [
  {
    url: "https://mcp-server-1.com",
    transport: "http",
    name: "mcp-server-1",
  },
];

// Pass MCP servers to the provider
<TamboProvider
  apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY!}
  components={components}
>
  <TamboMcpProvider mcpServers={mcpServers}>{children}</TamboMcpProvider>
</TamboProvider>;
```

## Design Tokens – Usage Guide
> Content from: ../tambo/TOKENS.md

## Core Principle

- Neutral by default, brand by exception: target 95% neutral usage across the UI.
- Brand colors appear only when communicating primary calls to action or intentional highlights.
- Every neutral choice must work in both light and dark themes without additional overrides.

## Text Tokens

- **`text-foreground`**: primary copy, headings, labels, and button text on neutral or muted backgrounds. Use whenever content needs maximum contrast.
- **`text-muted-foreground`**: secondary copy such as timestamps, captions, helper text, placeholders, loading states, and passive icons. Never apply it to interactive controls.
- **`text-primary-foreground`**: pair exclusively with `bg-primary` brand surfaces (primary CTAs, brand badges). Do not use on neutral backgrounds.
- **`text-primary`**: legacy accent token. Avoid inside the product UI; reserve it for explicit marketing treatments that have been reviewed.
- **Semantic status colors**: use dedicated success (`text-green-600 dark:text-green-400`), warning (`text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-400`), and error (`text-red-600 dark:text-red-400`) tokens. Never substitute brand colors for status messaging.

## Neutral Icon & Ghost Controls

- Neutral icon buttons and ghost controls use the outline recipe: `border border-border`, `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `hover:bg-muted`, and a `focus-visible:ring` treatment.
- Do not use `text-muted-foreground` on interactive icons; if an icon looks disabled before hover, the token choice is wrong.
- Keep hover and focus feedback neutral (background shift, ring, subtle shadow). Do not reintroduce brand color on neutral controls.

## Background Tokens

- **`bg-background`**: page bodies and large neutral surfaces.
- **`bg-card`**: elevated containers that sit above the page background.
- **`bg-muted`**: subdued surfaces for secondary panels, code blocks, and neutral interactive elements that should feel low emphasis.
- **`bg-secondary`**: filled neutral controls (segmented toggles, filter chips) that need slightly higher emphasis without brand color. Do not use for icon buttons; they follow the outline recipe above.
- **`bg-primary`**: primary CTAs only. Limit to one or two per page, and always pair with `text-primary-foreground`.

## Borders, Rings, and Focus

- **`border`**: default separators, card outlines, input borders, and dividers.
- **`border-primary` / `ring`**: focus and active states only. Never use them for passive decoration.
- Always provide a `focus-visible:ring` treatment for interactive components that rely on neutral colors so keyboard users get a clear affordance.

## Link Styling

- Inline links default to `text-foreground` with an underline in `decoration-muted-foreground` to keep the pattern neutral.
- Hover states must increase contrast: keep `hover:text-foreground` (never reduce opacity) and shift the underline to `decoration-foreground`.
- Avoid reintroducing brand colors into inline links unless the entire context is a marketing surface that explicitly calls for it.

## Button Patterns

- **Primary CTA buttons**: `bg-primary` + `text-primary-foreground` with neutral hover (`hover:bg-primary/90`). Reserved for the single dominant action in a surface (e.g., message submit).
- **Neutral outline buttons**: `border border-border bg-background text-foreground hover:bg-muted focus-visible:ring-*`. This is the default for message input toolbar actions, secondary form actions, icon buttons, and any neutral affordance that is not the primary CTA.
- **Neutral filled buttons**: `bg-secondary text-foreground hover:bg-secondary/80` only when a control needs more emphasis than the outline pattern (segmented toggles, filter chips). Never combine with icon-only actions.
- **Destructive buttons**: continue using the existing `bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground` patterns for irreversible actions.
- Every button variant must include a `focus-visible:ring` treatment and avoid `text-muted-foreground`.

## Form Inputs

- Inputs, textareas, and selects use `bg-background`, `border`, `text-foreground`, and `placeholder:text-muted-foreground`.
- Focus states rely on `focus-visible:ring`/`focus:border-primary` rather than swapping to brand text colors.
- Inline controls (checkboxes, radio, switch) use the neutral outline recipe by default; only elevate to brand surfaces when mirroring primary CTA intent.

## AGENTS.md
> Content from: ../tambo/cli/AGENTS.md

Detailed guidance for Claude Code agents working with the CLI package.

## Project Overview

The Tambo CLI (`tambo`) is a command-line tool for scaffolding, managing, and extending Tambo AI applications. It provides component generation, project initialization, dependency management, and development utilities.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Watch mode TypeScript compilation
npm run build           # Build CLI executable
npm run test            # Run Jest test suite
npm run lint            # ESLint code checking
npm run check-types     # TypeScript type checking

# CLI usage (after build)
tambo init                    # Initialize Tambo in existing project
tambo add <component>        # Add components from registry
tambo list                   # List available components
tambo create-app <name>      # Create new Tambo application
tambo update                 # Update existing components
tambo upgrade               # Upgrade Tambo dependencies
```

## Architecture Overview

### Command Structure

- **Entry point**: `src/cli.ts` - Main CLI setup with meow
- **Commands**: `src/commands/` - Individual command implementations
  - `init.ts` - Project initialization
  - `add/` - Component installation system
  - `create-app.ts` - New app creation
  - `list/` - Component listing
  - `update.ts` - Component updates
  - `upgrade/` - Dependency upgrades

### Component Registry System

- **Registry**: `src/registry/` - Template components with metadata. These
  components are copied into a user's project when they run the `tambo add`
  command. Any changes to the component files should be made in this package first,
  and then duplicated into the showcase/ and docs/ packages.
- **Structure**: Each component has:
  - `config.json` - Metadata (name, description, dependencies)
  - Component files (`.tsx`, `.ts`)
  - Supporting files (CSS, utilities)

### Key Features

- Automatic dependency resolution and installation
- Tailwind CSS configuration management
- Project structure detection and setup
- Interactive prompts for user choices
- Template-based component generation

## Key Files and Directories

- `src/cli.ts` - Main CLI entry point with command routing
- `src/commands/add/` - Component installation logic
- `src/registry/` - Component templates and configurations
- `src/constants/` - Shared constants and paths
- `src/templates/` - Project templates

## Development Patterns

### New End-User Features Process

We have a doc-first approach to developing new features in our CLI. This means we write the documentation first, then write the code to implement the feature. Our docs are in the docs site (read ../docs/AGENTS.md).

1. Read all existing documentation and code in the repository
2. Read the relevant code to ensure you understand the existing code and context
3. Before writing any code, write a detailed description of the feature in the docs site
4. Then write the code to implement the feature

If you do update the components directly, you should also update the documentation in the docs site (read ../docs/AGENTS.md).

### Adding New Commands

1. Create command file in `src/commands/`
2. Implement handler function
3. Add to CLI routing in `src/cli.ts`
4. Update help text and flags

### Adding New Components

1. Create component directory in `src/registry/`
2. Add `config.json` with metadata
3. Include component files and dependencies
4. Test installation and generation

## Testing

Tests are in `tests/` directory using Jest with ESM support and memfs for filesystem mocking.

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                 # Run all tests
npm test -- --watch     # Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- add          # Run specific test file
```

### Writing Tests

- Use `memfs` (`vol.fromJSON()`) to mock filesystem operations
- Mock external dependencies: `child_process.execSync`, `inquirer.prompt`, registry utilities
- Helper functions in `tests/helpers/mock-fs-setup.ts` for common test scenarios
- See `tests/commands/list.test.ts` and `tests/commands/add.test.ts` for examples

Key requirements:

- Command handlers must have unit tests
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies (don't hit real filesystem/network/npm)

## Important Development Rules

- CLI is built as ESM module only
- All components must be SSR compatible
- Follow existing patterns for command structure
- Write tests for new commands and logic changes
- Test component generation end-to-end
- Update help text for new commands/options
- Always run tests before committing: `npm test`

## CLAUDE.md
> Content from: ../tambo/cli/CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read @AGENTS.md before making any changes or using any tools. It contains detailed architectural guidance and command workflows.**

## Quick Reference

The Tambo CLI (`tambo`) - command-line tool for scaffolding and managing Tambo AI applications.

## tambo-cli
> **Note:** The TamboProvider manages client-side state for features like thread management, message history, and component state. The `"use client"` directive is required.

The Official CLI for tambo ui.

**⚠️ Note: This project is currently in active development. APIs and features may change.**

## Quick Start

```bash
npx tambo full-send
```

This command will:

1. Set up your Tambo API key
2. Install required components
3. Configure your project with necessary dependencies

## Installation

While you can install globally, we recommend using `npx` to ensure you're always using the latest version:

```bash
# Using npx (recommended)
npx tambo <command>
```

## Commands

### `init`

Initialize Tambo in your Next.js project. Two modes available:

```bash
# Full setup - recommended for new projects
npx tambo full-send

# Basic setup - just API key configuration
npx tambo init
```

### `add <component-name>`

Add a Tambo component to your project:

```bash
# Basic usage
npx tambo add message

# With legacy peer dependencies flag
npx tambo add message --legacy-peer-deps
```

### `update <component-name>`

Update an existing Tambo component in your project:

```bash
# Basic usage
npx tambo update message

# With legacy peer dependencies flag
npx tambo update message --legacy-peer-deps
```

Available components:

#### Chat Components

- `message-thread-full` - Full-screen chat interface with history and typing indicators
- `message-thread-panel` - Split-view chat with integrated workspace
- `message-thread-collapsible` - Collapsible chat for sidebars
- `thread-content` - Message thread with grouping and timestamps
- `thread-history` - Chat history management
- `message-input` - Rich text input
- `message` - Individual message display with content formatting
- `message-suggestions` - AI-powered message suggestions

#### Navigation & Control

- `control-bar` - Spotlight-style command palette
- `thread-list` - Organized chat thread navigation

#### Form & Input

- `form` - Dynamic form with validation
- `input-fields` - Text inputs
- `map` - Interactive Map

#### Data Visualization

- `graph` - Interactive charts (line, bar, scatter, pie)

## Project Structure

When you add components, they'll be installed in your project following this structure:

```
your-next-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ui/
│   │       ├── message-thread-full.tsx
│   │       └── ...
│   ├── lib/
│   │   └── tambo.ts       # Tool registry
│   └── app/
│       └── layout.tsx     # you could add TamboProvider here (for entire app)
└── .env.local            # Your API key configuration
```

## Environment Setup

The CLI will automatically create/update your `.env.local` file with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## TamboProvider Setup

After initialization, you can add the TamboProvider in one of two ways:

### Option 1: Page-specific (easiest)

If you just want to add Tambo to specific pages or components, this is the quickest approach:

```jsx
// In a specific page file (e.g., app/ai-chat/page.tsx)
"use client"; // Important! TamboProvider is a client component

import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { components } from "../../lib/tambo"; // Import components
import { MessageThreadFull } from "@/components/tambo/message-thread-full";

export default function AIChat() {
  return (
    <TamboProvider
      apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY ?? ""}
      components={components}
    >
      <MessageThreadFull />
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

### Option 2: App-wide in layout file (best practice)

This approach provides better context sharing between components and is recommended for production apps:

```jsx
// In your layout file (e.g., app/layout.tsx)
"use client"; // Important! TamboProvider is a client component

import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { components } from "../lib/tambo"; // Import components

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <TamboProvider
          apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY ?? ""}
          components={components}
        >
          {children}
        </TamboProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Call for Tambo Templates
> Note on analytics: We get this idea a lot. For an analytics template to stand out, it should be unique in its data source or its approach.

## AGENTS.md

Detailed guidance for Claude Code agents working with the create-tambo-app package.

## Project Overview

The `create-tambo-app` package is a lightweight bootstrapper that creates new Tambo AI applications. It acts as a proxy to the latest version of the `tambo` CLI's `create-app` command.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Watch mode TypeScript compilation
npm run build        # Build executable
npm run lint         # ESLint code checking

# Usage (after build/publish)
npx create-tambo-app my-app    # Create new Tambo app
npm create tambo-app my-app    # Alternative syntax
```

## Architecture Overview

### Proxy Pattern

The package implements a simple proxy pattern:

1. Receives command-line arguments
2. Delegates to `npx tambo@latest create-app` with those arguments
3. Ensures users always get the latest CLI version

### Single Entry Point

- **`src/index.ts`** - Entire package implementation
- Uses Node.js `spawn` to execute `tambo` CLI
- Inherits stdio for seamless user experience
- Exits with same code as underlying process

## Key Features

- **Always Latest**: Uses `npx tambo@latest` to ensure latest CLI
- **Argument Passthrough**: All arguments passed to underlying CLI
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **No Dependencies**: Minimal package with no runtime dependencies

## Development Patterns

### Modifying Behavior

Since this is a simple proxy, most functionality changes should be made in the main `tambo` CLI's `create-app` command rather than here.

### Testing

Test the built package locally:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/index.js my-test-app
```

## Important Development Rules

- Keep this package minimal and focused
- All logic should be in the main `tambo` CLI
- Maintain compatibility with npm's `create-*` conventions
- Test cross-platform compatibility
- Ensure proper exit code handling

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read @AGENTS.md before making any changes or using any tools. It contains detailed architectural guidance and proxy patterns.**

## Quick Reference

The `create-tambo-app` package - lightweight bootstrapper for creating new Tambo AI applications.

## create-tambo-app
> Content from: ../tambo/create-tambo-app/README.md

A command-line tool to create new Tambo applications with zero configuration.

## Overview

`create-tambo-app` is the official way to create new [tambo](https://tambo.co) applications. It provides a streamlined experience for setting up new tambo projects with all the necessary configurations and dependencies.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 20

yarn create tambo-app my-app

# Using pnpm
pnpm create tambo-app my-app

# Using npx directly
npx create-tambo-app my-app
```

## Command Line Options

All arguments passed to `create-tambo-app` will be forwarded to the Tambo CLI's `create-app` command. For example:

```bash
npm create tambo-app@latest my-app
```

## What's Next?

After creating your application:

1. Navigate to your project directory: `cd my-app`
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open your browser to see your new Tambo application

## AGENTS.md
> Content from: ../tambo/docs/AGENTS.md

Detailed guidance for Claude Code agents working with the Docs package.

## Project Overview

The Docs package (`@tambo-ai/docs`) is a Next.js application serving as the official Tambo AI documentation site. Built with Fumadocs, it provides comprehensive guides, API reference, and interactive examples.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start dev server with Turbo mode
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run postinstall  # Process MDX files (automatic)
npm run postbuild    # Generate sitemap (automatic)
```

## Architecture Overview

### Fumadocs Structure

- **MDX Processing**: `source.config.ts` - Schema validation and processing
- **Content System**: `src/lib/source.ts` - Page tree and navigation
- **Layout**: Fumadocs provides documentation layout with sidebar
- **Routing**: Dynamic routing via `[[...slug]]/page.tsx`

### Content Organization

- **Docs**: `content/docs/` - All MDX documentation files
- **Navigation**: `meta.json` files define sidebar structure
- **Assets**: `public/assets/docs/` - Images, videos, demos
- **Components**: Interactive Tambo components in docs

### Key Features

- MDX-based content with React components
- Auto-generated navigation from folder structure
- Interactive Tambo component examples
- Mermaid diagram support
- Search functionality
- GitHub integration

## Key Files and Directories

- `content/docs/` - Documentation content (MDX)
- `src/components/mdx/` - Custom MDX components
- `src/components/tambo/` - Tambo component implementations
- `src/lib/tambo.ts` - Component registration for interactive docs
- `source.config.ts` - Fumadocs configuration
- `src/app/layout.config.tsx` - Base layout configuration

## Development Patterns

### Adding Documentation

1. Create MDX file with frontmatter (title, description, icon)
2. Update relevant `meta.json` for navigation
3. Add assets to `public/assets/docs/` if needed
4. Test locally with `npm run dev`

### Adding Interactive Components

1. Create component in `src/components/tambo/`
2. Register in `src/lib/tambo.ts`
3. Use in MDX content directly
4. Ensure SSR compatibility

### Content Guidelines

- Use proper MDX syntax with code highlighting
- Include working examples users can copy
- Maintain consistent heading structure
- Optimize images and include alt text

## Documentation Structure and Patterns

### Site Organization Philosophy

The documentation follows a **progressive disclosure** pattern - starting with quick wins (quickstart), moving through core concepts, then diving into specifics. This structure mirrors the user's learning journey.

#### Information Architecture

In general, try to fit changes into the following categories. If you can't find a good fit, suggest a new category but ask the user for confirmation.

1. **Getting Started** - Immediate value with working examples
   - Quickstart: Template installation and first interactions
   - Integration: Adding Tambo to existing projects
   - Component basics: Understanding registration patterns

2. **Concepts** - Core architectural understanding (components, threads, tools, streaming)
   - Components: Registration, schemas, lifecycle, interactables
   - Message Threads: Sending messages, responses, history management, status tracking
   - Tools: Function calling, schemas, orchestration
   - Model Context Protocol: Overview, providers overview (client-side and server-side comparison, rich content support), client-side connections, server-side connections, features overview (elicitations, tools, sampling, prompts)
   - Streaming: Real-time responses, component streaming, status monitoring
   - User Authentication: OAuth providers, session management, context keys
   - Additional Context: Dynamic helpers, page context, interactable tracking, context attachments
   - Suggestions: AI-generated action recommendations

3. **Best Practices** - Guidance for production implementations
   - Component data props optimization
   - Performance considerations
   - Error handling patterns
   - Security best practices

4. **API Reference** - Technical specifications
   - React hooks: Complete signatures, parameters, return values
   - TypeScript interfaces and types
   - Provider configurations

5. **CLI** - Command-line tooling documentation
   - Commands: add, create-app, init, list, migrate, update, upgrade
   - Configuration: Project setup, customization options
   - Workflows: Development patterns, component management
   - Global options: Flags and environment variables

6. **Models** - Configuration and customization
   - Custom LLM parameters: Temperature, max tokens, model selection
   - Labels: Organizing and categorizing interactions
   - Reasoning Models: Advanced thinking/reasoning capabilities for OpenAI and Gemini models
   - Provider-specific configurations

7. **Examples & Templates** - Real-world implementations
   - Chat starter applications
   - Integration examples (Supabase MCP client)
   - Use case demonstrations
   - Community templates and patterns

Please update the `Information Architecture` section in the AGENTS.md file to reflect changes when you make them. Keeping this up to date is VERY IMPORTANT.

### Navigation Patterns (`meta.json`)

```json
{
  "title": "Section Name",
  "pages": [
    "index",
    "---Subsection Name---", // Section separators using ---
    "...subfolder", // Include entire subfolder
    "specific-page" // Individual pages
  ]
}
```

**Rules:**

- Use `---Section Name---` for visual separators in sidebar
- Use `...foldername` to include all pages from a subfolder
- Order pages by learning progression, not alphabetically
- Keep section titles concise (2-3 words max)

### Content Writing Patterns

#### Frontmatter Standards

```yaml
---
title: Page Title (descriptive, not technical)
description: Clear, actionable description under 160 characters
icon: LucideIconName # Optional, use relevant Lucide React icons
---
```

**Rules:**

- Title should be user-focused, not implementation-focused
- Description should complete: "This page helps you..."
- Icons enhance navigation but aren't required

#### Content Structure Template

```mdx
# Brief opening paragraph explaining what this achieves

## Core concept/pattern (if applicable)

Brief explanation with code example

## Step-by-step implementation

### Step 1: Clear action

### Step 2: Clear action

### Step 3: Clear action

## Advanced usage/customization (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting/Common issues (if applicable)
```

#### Writing Voice and Tone

- **Direct and Practical**: Focus on what users need to accomplish
- **Present Tense**: "Tambo allows you to..." not "Tambo will allow..."
- **Active Voice**: "Register components with Tambo" not "Components are registered"
- **Conversational but Professional**: Use "you" and "your app"
- **Outcome-Focused**: Start sections with what the user achieves

#### Code Examples Philosophy

**Always show complete, runnable examples:**

```tsx
// ✅ Complete context
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { z } from "zod";

const components = [
  {
    name: "WeatherCard",
    description: "Shows current weather for a city",
    component: WeatherCard,
    propsSchema: z.object({
      city: z.string(),
      temperature: z.number(),
    }),
  },
];

export function App() {
  return (
    <TamboProvider components={components}>
      <Chat />
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

**Rules:**

- Include necessary imports
- Show complete examples users can copy-paste
- Use realistic prop names and values
- Include error handling where relevant
- Prefer TypeScript over JavaScript
- Do not include styling in the code examples.
- Keep code examples minimal and to the point.

### Interactive Elements

#### Learn More Cards

Use the `<LearnMore>` component for cross-references:

```mdx
import LearnMore from "@/components/learn-more";

<LearnMore
  title="Component Registration"
  description="Learn how to register components with Tambo"
  href="/concepts/components"
  icon={ComponentIcon} // Optional
/>
```

#### Image Guidelines

Always use ImageZoom for better UX:

```mdx
import { ImageZoom } from "fumadocs-ui/components/image-zoom";

<ImageZoom
  src="/assets/docs/example.gif"
  alt="Descriptive alt text"
  width={500}
  height={500}
  style={{ border: "2px solid #e5e7eb", borderRadius: "8px", width: "80%" }}
/>
```

**Image Standards:**

- Use descriptive alt text
- Add subtle borders and rounded corners
- Keep width at 80% for responsive design
- Optimize GIFs and images for web
- Store in `/public/assets/docs/`

#### Code Block Enhancements

Use titles for context:

```bash title="Install dependencies"
npm install @tambo-ai/react
```

### Content Consistency Patterns

#### CLI Documentation Style

- Show command first: `npx tambo add form`
- Explain what it does in practical terms
- List available options/components
- Include realistic examples
- Show automatic behaviors (dependency installation, etc.)

#### API/Hook Documentation Style

- Lead with the practical use case
- Show the hook signature
- Provide complete implementation example
- Explain key parameters and return values
- Include common patterns and edge cases

#### Concept Pages Structure

- **Index page**: High-level overview with links to specifics
- **Implementation pages**: Step-by-step guides
- **Advanced pages**: Optimization and customization
- Cross-link related concepts extensively

### Asset Management

#### File Naming

- Use descriptive, kebab-case names: `recipe-card-example.gif`
- Include context: `quickstart-demo.mp4` not `demo.mp4`
- Version large changes: `component-registration-v2.png`

### MDX Component Usage

#### Available Components

- **ImageZoom**: All images should use this
- **LearnMore**: Cross-references and next steps
- **Mermaid**: Diagrams and flow charts
- **defaultMdxComponents**: Tabs, Callouts, Code blocks with syntax highlighting

#### Custom Components

When adding custom components:

1. Create in `src/components/`
2. Register in `src/mdx-components.tsx`
3. Ensure SSR compatibility
4. Follow accessibility guidelines

## Important Development Rules

- All components must be SSR compatible
- Maintain frontmatter for all MDX files
- Keep meta.json navigation updated
- Follow progressive disclosure in content organization
- Use complete, runnable code examples
- Include descriptive alt text for all images
- Cross-reference related concepts extensively
- Test all examples work in latest template
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Use ImageZoom for all documentation images

## Project Overview

This is the **@tambo-ai/react** package - the core React SDK for building AI-powered generative UI applications. It provides hooks, providers, and utilities that enable AI to dynamically generate and manage React components through natural language interaction.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Watch mode compilation (CJS + ESM)
npm run build           # Build both CJS and ESM outputs
npm run test            # Run Jest tests
npm run lint            # ESLint code checking
npm run check-types     # TypeScript type checking
npm run clean           # Remove build artifacts
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Provider System

The SDK uses a nested provider hierarchy (`src/providers/tambo-provider.tsx`):

1. **TamboClientProvider** - API client, authentication, session management
2. **TamboRegistryProvider** - Component and tool registration system
3. **TamboContextHelpersProvider** - Additional context utilities
4. **TamboThreadProvider** - Message thread and conversation management
5. **TamboThreadInputProvider** - User input handling and submission
6. **TamboComponentProvider** - Component lifecycle and state management
7. **TamboInteractableProvider** - Interactive component tracking

### Component Registration Pattern

```typescript
const components: TamboComponent[] = [
  {
    name: "ComponentName",
    description: "Clear description for AI understanding",
    component: ReactComponent,
    propsSchema: zodSchema, // Zod schema for props validation
  },
];
```

### Tool Registration Pattern

Tools can be registered with an optional `transformToContent` function to control how tool responses are converted into content parts:

```typescript
const tools: TamboTool[] = [
  {
    name: "toolName",
    description: "Tool description for AI",
    tool: async (args) => {
      // Tool implementation
      return result;
    },
    toolSchema: zodSchema, // Zod function schema
    // Optional: Transform tool response to content parts
    transformToContent: (result) => [
      { type: "text", text: result.text },
      // Can include image_url, input_audio, etc.
    ],
  },
];
```

By default, tool responses are stringified and wrapped in a text content part. The `transformToContent` function allows tools to return rich content including images, audio, or mixed media. This is particularly useful for MCP tools that already return content in the proper format.

### Key Hook System

- **`useTambo()`** - Primary hook accessing all Tambo functionality
- **`useTamboThreadInput()`** - Message submission, input state management
- **`useTamboComponentState()`** - AI-managed component state with streaming
- **`useTamboStreamStatus()`** - Monitor AI response streaming status
- **`useTamboThreadList()`** - Thread management and navigation
- **`useTamboInteractable()`** - Track interactive component registry

## Key Files and Directories

### Source Structure

- `src/hooks/` - React hooks for Tambo functionality
- `src/providers/` - Context providers and state management
- `src/model/` - TypeScript interfaces and data models
- `src/util/` - Utility functions and helpers
- `src/mcp/` - Model Context Protocol integration
- `src/context-helpers/` - Dynamic context generation utilities

### Critical Files

- `src/providers/tambo-provider.tsx` - Main provider implementation
- `src/model/component-metadata.ts` - Component and tool type definitions
- `src/hooks/use-tambo-threads.ts` - Thread management logic
- `src/providers/tambo-prop-stream-provider/` - Streaming prop system

## Development Patterns

### Component State Management

Components can have AI-managed state using `useTamboComponentState`:

```typescript
const [state, setState, { isPending }] = useTamboComponentState(
  "uniqueStateKey",
  initialState,
);
```

### Thread Context Isolation

Each interface should use unique context keys for thread separation:

- Enables multiple independent AI conversations
- Threads persist via API and are retrieved by context key
- Managed through `contextKey` prop on `TamboProvider`

### Streaming Response Handling

The SDK supports real-time streaming of AI responses:

- Text content streams character by character
- Component props stream and update in real-time
- Status monitoring via `useTamboStreamStatus()`

## Build System

### Dual Build Output

- **CommonJS** (`dist/`) - Node.js compatibility, server-side rendering
- **ESM** (`esm/`) - Modern bundlers, tree-shaking support
- **TypeScript declarations** included in both outputs

### Dependencies

- **Peer Dependencies** - React 18/19, React DOM, TypeScript types
- **Core Dependencies** - Tambo TypeScript SDK, React Query, Zod
- **MCP Support** - Model Context Protocol SDK for tool extensions

## Testing

### Test Structure

- Tests in `__tests__/` directories alongside source files
- Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock implementations in `src/testing/` for external dependencies

### Key Test Areas

- Hook functionality and state management
- Provider context passing and updates
- Component registration and lifecycle
- Streaming response handling
- MCP integration

## MCP Integration

Model Context Protocol support enables extending AI capabilities:

- Client-side MCP connections via `TamboMcpProvider`
- Tool discovery and execution
- Resource access and management
- Custom protocol implementations

## Development Patterns

### Important Development Rules

- All components must be SSR compatible
- Use strict TypeScript - no `any` types
- Use `z.infer<typeof schema>` for Zod-derived prop types
- Maintain backward compatibility in public APIs
- Follow React hooks rules and best practices

### New End-User Features Process

We have a doc-first approach to developing new features in our React SDK. This means we write the documentation first, then write the code to implement the feature. Our docs are in the docs site directory at ../docs (read [../docs/AGENTS.md](../docs/AGENTS.md)).

1. Read relevant documentation and code in the repository
2. Read the relevant code to ensure you understand the existing code and context
3. Before writing any code, write a detailed description of the feature in the docs site
4. Then write the code to implement the feature

## CLAUDE.md
> Content from: ../tambo/react-sdk/CLAUDE.md

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read @AGENTS.md before making any changes or using any tools. It contains detailed architectural guidance and development patterns.**

## Quick Reference

The **@tambo-ai/react** package - the core React SDK for AI-powered generative UI applications.

## Tambo AI React SDK
> <MessageThreadFull />

Tambo allows AI models to dynamically render React components in response to user messages, enabling AI assistants to display interactive widgets, charts, forms, and other UI elements instead of just text. Tambo is a great way to add generative UI to your AI assistant, copilot, or agent.

This package provides react hooks to talk to the Tambo API and render custom components inline, but does not provide any UI components on its own. For pre-built UI components that use this package, see [tambo-ui](https://ui.tambo.co).

## Build apps with Generative UI and MCP

![template gif](../assets/template.gif)

Get started using our [AI chat template](https://github.com/tambo-ai/tambo-template):

```bash
npx tambo create-app my-tambo-app
```

This will create a new NextJS project with Tambo pre-configured, and then step you through the process of setting up a Tambo project, including signing up for an API key, and adding it to `.env.local`.

### Adding components to an existing project

If you have an existing project, you can add components to it. First, initialize your project:

```bash
npx tambo init
```

This will step you through the process of setting up a Tambo project, including signing up for an API key, and adding it to `.env.local`.

Then add components from our library to your project in the `components/ui` directory:

```bash
npx tambo add message-thread-full
```

See the complete component library at [ui.tambo.co](https://ui.tambo.co).

### Manual installation

You can also install Tambo manually:

```bash
npm install @tambo-ai/react
# or
yarn add @tambo-ai/react
```

## How does Tambo work?

Tambo uses a client-side registry of React components that can be used by an LLM.

### 1. Register your components

```tsx
import { type TamboComponent } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { Graph, graphSchema } from "@/components/ui/graph";

const components: TamboComponent[] = [
  {
    name: "Graph",
    description:
      "A component that renders various types of charts (bar, line, pie) using Recharts. Supports customizable data visualization with labels, datasets, and styling options.",
    component: Graph,
    propsSchema: graphSchema, // zod schema
  },
  // Add more components
];
```

### 2. Wrap your app in a TamboProvider

If you are using one of Tambo's pre-built components, you can wrap your app in a TamboProvider.

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { MessageThreadFull } from "@/components/ui/message-thread-full";

// In your chat page
<TamboProvider
  apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY!}
  components={components}

</TamboProvider>;
```

You can also use your own components with the TamboProvider:

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";

<TamboProvider
  apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY!}
  components={components}
>
  <YourChatComponents />
</TamboProvider>;
```

### 3. Render AI-generated components

This is also handled automatically for you if you are using the `MessageThreadFull` component.

For custom components rendered by Tambo, you can use the `useTamboCurrentMessage` hook inside the component to access the current message.

_Example (Tambo‑rendered custom component):_

```tsx
import { useTamboCurrentMessage } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export function TamboRenderedMessage() {
  const message = useTamboCurrentMessage();
  return (
    <div>
      <div>Role: {message.role}</div>
      <div>
        {message.content.map((part, i) =>
          part.type === "text" ? (
            <div key={i}>{part.text}</div>
          ) : (
            <div key={i}>Non-text content: {part.type}</div>
          ),
        )}
      </div>
      {/* If Tambo provided rendered output, include it */}
      <div>{message.renderedComponent}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

If you're rendering your own message list (outside of a Tambo‑rendered component), you can instead pass each `message` as a prop, as shown below:

```tsx
import { useTambo, type TamboThreadMessage } from "@tambo-ai/react";

function ChatHistory() {
  const { thread } = useTambo();
  return (
    <div>
      {thread.messages.map((message) => (
        <CustomMessage key={message.id} message={message} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function CustomMessage({ message }: { message: TamboThreadMessage }) {
  // Render the component
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render the message content */}
      <div>Role: {message.role}</div>
      <div>
        {message.content.map((part, i) =>
          part.type === "text" ? (
            <div key={i}>{part.text}</div>
          ) : (
            <div key={i}>Non-text content: {part.type}</div>
          ),
        )}
      </div>
      {/* Render the component, if any */}
      <div>{message.renderedComponent}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. Submit user messages

If you are using the `MessageThreadFull` component, you can skip this step, it is handled automatically.

If you are using a custom component, you can use the `useTamboThreadInput` hook to submit user messages.

```tsx
import { useTamboThreadInput } from "@tambo-ai/react";

function ChatInput() {
  const { submit, value, setValue } = useTamboThreadInput();

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={value}
        onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button onClick={() => submit()}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 5. Put it all together

```tsx
function ChatInterface() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ChatHistory />
      <ChatInput />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### In depth examples

#### 1. Displaying a message thread:

```tsx
import { useTambo, useTamboThreadInput } from "@tambo-ai/react";

function ChatInterface() {
  const { thread } = useTambo();
  const { value, setValue, submit } = useTamboThreadInput();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Display messages */}
      <div>
        {thread.messages.map((message) => (
          <div key={message.id} className={`message ${message.role}`}>
            <div>
              {message.content.map((part, i) =>
                part.type === "text" ? (
                  <div key={i}>{part.text}</div>
                ) : (
                  <div key={i}>Non-text content: {part.type}</div>
                ),
              )}
            </div>
            {message.renderedComponent}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>

      {/* Input form */}
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          submit();
        }}
        className="input-form"
      >
        <input
          type="text"
          value={value}
          onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)}
          placeholder="Type your message..."
        />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 2. Adding AI-Generated Components:

Create components that can be dynamically generated by the AI:

```tsx
// components/WeatherCard.jsx
import { useTamboComponentState } from "@tambo-ai/react";

export function WeatherCard({
  location,
  temperature,
  condition,
}: {
  location: string;
  temperature: number;
  condition: string;
}) {
  // useTamboComponentState manages state that persists even if
  // the component is unmounted
  const [isMetric, setIsMetric] = useTamboComponentState(
    "isMetric", // unique identifier for this component's state
    false, // default value
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{location}</h3>
      <div>
        {isMetric ? temperature : (temperature * 1.8 + 32).toFixed(1)}°
        {isMetric ? "C" : "F"}
      </div>
      <div>{condition}</div>
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={isMetric}
        onChange={(e) => setIsMetric(e.target.checked)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 3. Register your components:

```tsx
// App.jsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { WeatherCard } from "./components/WeatherCard";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define your components
const components = [
  {
    name: "WeatherCard",
    description: "A component that displays weather information",
    component: WeatherCard,
    propsSchema: z.object({
      temperature: z.number(),
      condition: z.string(),
      location: z.string(),
    }),
  },
];

// Pass them to the provider
function App() {
  return (
    <TamboProvider apiKey="your-api-key" components={components}>
      <YourApp />
    </TamboProvider>
  );
}
```

### Adding Tools for the AI

Register tools to make them available to the AI:

```tsx
import { TamboTool } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { z } from "zod";

// Define your tools
const tools: TamboTool[] = [
  {
    name: "getWeather",
    description: "Fetches current weather data for a given location",
    tool: async (location: string, units: string = "celsius") => {
      // Example implementation
      const weather = await fetchWeatherData(location);
      return {
        temperature: weather.temp,
        condition: weather.condition,
        location: weather.city,
      };
    },
    toolSchema: z
      .function()
      .args(
        z.string().describe("Location name (city)"),
        z
          .string()
          .optional()
          .describe("Temperature units (celsius/fahrenheit)"),
      )
      .returns(
        z.object({
          temperature: z.number(),
          condition: z.string(),
          location: z.string(),
        }),
      ),
  },
];

// Pass tools to the provider
<TamboProvider apiKey="your-api-key" tools={tools}>
  <YourApp />
</TamboProvider>;
```

#### Advanced: Transforming Tool Responses

By default, tool responses are converted to strings and wrapped in a text content part. For tools that return rich content (like images, audio, or mixed media), you can provide a `transformToContent` function to convert the tool's response into an array of content parts:

```tsx
const tools: TamboTool[] = [
  {
    name: "getImageData",
    description: "Fetches image data with metadata",
    tool: async (imageId: string) => {
      const data = await fetchImageData(imageId);
      return {
        url: data.imageUrl,
        description: data.description,
      };
    },
    toolSchema: z
      .function()
      .args(z.string().describe("Image ID"))
      .returns(
        z.object({
          url: z.string(),
          description: z.string(),
        }),
      ),
    // Transform the tool response into content parts
    transformToContent: (result) => [
      { type: "text", text: result.description },
      { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: result.url } },
    ],
  },
];
```

This feature is particularly useful for MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools, which already return content in the correct format. The MCP integration automatically uses `transformToContent` to pass through rich content.

### Using MCP Servers

```tsx
import { TamboProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react";
import { TamboMcpProvider } from "@tambo-ai/react/mcp";
import { MCPTransport } from "@tambo-ai/react/mcp";

const mcpServers = [
  {
    url: "https://mcp-server-1.com",
    transport: MCPTransport.HTTP,
    name: "mcp-server-1",
  },
];

// Pass MCP servers to the provider
<TamboProvider
  apiKey={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TAMBO_API_KEY!}
  components={components}
>
  <TamboMcpProvider mcpServers={mcpServers}>
    <YourApp />
  </TamboMcpProvider>
</TamboProvider>;
```

## AGENTS.md
> Content from: ../tambo/showcase/AGENTS.md

Detailed guidance for Claude Code agents working with the Showcase package.

## Project Overview

The Showcase (`@tambo-ai/showcase`) is a Next.js application that demonstrates all Tambo AI components and patterns. It serves as both a component library browser and an interactive testing ground for generative UI capabilities.

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start Next.js development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # ESLint code checking
npm run clean        # Remove .next build artifacts
```

## Architecture Overview

### Component Demonstration System

- **Demo Pages**: `src/app/components/` - Individual component showcases
- **Interactive Examples**: Live AI chat interfaces for each component type
- **UI Components**: `src/components/ui/` - Actual Tambo components
- **Generative Interfaces**: `src/components/generative/` - AI-powered chat demos

### Navigation Structure

- **Blocks**: Full message thread components and control systems
- **Message Primitives**: Basic messaging building blocks
- **Generative**: AI-generated forms, graphs, maps, input fields
- **Canvas**: Interactive canvas-based components

### Key Features

- Live component registration and AI interaction
- Context-isolated threads for each component type
- Dark/light theme support with custom styling
- Responsive design with mobile-specific providers

## Key Files and Directories

- `src/app/components/` - Component demonstration pages
- `src/components/generative/` - AI chat interface implementations
- `src/components/ui/` - Tambo component implementations
- `src/lib/navigation.ts` - Site navigation structure
- `src/providers/` - Theme and mobile context providers
- `src/styles/showcase-theme.css` - Custom theming system

## Development Patterns

### Adding New Component Demos

1. Create page in `src/app/components/`
2. Implement chat interface in `src/components/generative/`
3. Add component to `src/components/ui/`
4. Update navigation in `src/lib/navigation.ts`

### Theme System

- CSS custom properties for theming
- Dark mode via `next-themes`
- Custom Sentient font integration
- Tailwind CSS with showcase-specific styles

## Important Development Rules

- React Strict Mode disabled (react-leaflet compatibility)
- All components must be SSR compatible
- Use unique context keys for thread isolation
- Follow existing demo patterns for consistency
- Include interactive examples for all components

## Design Token Guidance

- Default to `text-foreground` and `text-muted-foreground` for UI copy; reserve `text-primary` for elements on `bg-primary`.
- Reference the Storybook story `Design System/Token Usage` for canonical correct vs incorrect examples.
- Treat any `text-secondary` usage in demos as a blocker and migrate to neutral tokens before shipping.
